The test matrices are put in a directory called `ai-artifacts/test-matrices/`.
`ai-artifacts/test-matrices/` has a subdirectory with the same name as the file under test.
  - Any characters that cannot be used in a file name are converted to `-`
  - Within the subdirectory, there is a test-matrix file for each public function name
  - The table for the file under test is written to this test-matrix file

So if I'm testing a file at lib/lms/courses/course.ex and that has a public
`changeset/2` function and an `extra_stuff/3` function, I would exect the
following file structure:

-- Project Root
 |
 - `ai-artifacts/test-matrices/`
   |
   - `lib---lms--courses---course.ex`
     |
     - `changeset---2.md` (markdown file with test matrix for `changeset/2` function)
     |
     - `extra_stuff---3.md` (markdown file with test matrix for `extra_stuff/3` function)
