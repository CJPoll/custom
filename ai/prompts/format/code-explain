I have some code I'd like you to explain for me: $ARGUMENTS

For each bit of code to explain, let's structure the format according to this:

- Each code area to explain is in an ordered list, with the file (and any other
  differentiating description) as the text with the number.
- Nested under that number, each as an unordered list item:
  - The file the code is in
  - The reason it's relevant
  - Changes we may want to make to support the project (3 sentences maximum)
  - The level of test coverage of the identified code, with an emphasis on how
    much risk there is of causing a breakage if we modify the code (2 sentences
    maximum)
