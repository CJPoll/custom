Correct output for test matrices is formatted in this way
- First is the full file name
- Then for each public function output should be formatted as:
  - First is the function name, including arity (e.g. `changeset/2`)
  - Second is a set of test cases with each test case as a separate entry in
    markdown format. Each entry is a separate list-item (e.g. `- [test-case description]`)
    Each test case has the following four elements nest under it as an ordered
    list:
    1. Test case description
    2. Inputs to the test case. If there is more than one input, 
    3. Expected outputs (return values, logs, raised exceptions, etc.)
    4. Whether this is `Happy Path`, `Validation`, `Error Handling`, `Control
       Flow Decisioning` or some other category of behavior testing
