THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I want you to fix Dialyzer issues. Here is how you reproduce the issues:
    | To run dialyzer for the entire application: `mix dialyzer`
    | Dialyzer can not be run against just a single file.
    |  - However, you should still only try to fix at most 5 issues at a time.
    |  - Those 5 issues must always be the first 5 issues in the output.

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
