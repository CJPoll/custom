I have some code I'd like you to explain for me: $ARGUMENTS

For each bit of code to explain, let's structure the format like this:
- The file the code is in
- The reason it's relevant
- Changes we may want to make to support the project (as a nested bullet list -
  6 bullets maximum)
- The level of test coverage of the identified code, with an emphasis on how
  much risk there is of causing a breakage if we modify the code (2 sentences
  maximum)
