I have a file for which I want to generate regression tests. Do not generate any code. Do not generate any test.

Generate for me a comprehensive test matrix for the module. Do not include performance tests. Do cover failure cases. Ensure each code branch in the file is covered.
Correct output is formatted in this way:
- First is the full file name
- Then for each public function output should be formatted as:
  - First is the function name, including arity (e.g. `changeset/2`)
  - Second is a table I can copy/paste into notion with each test case as a separate row
