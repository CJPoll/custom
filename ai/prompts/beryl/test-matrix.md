# Test Matrix
In @~/dev/beryl/lib/schemas/test_matrix.json, we define a JSON schema that this feature's `tests.yaml` (the path to which is in context) MUST conform to.

For each of the side-effect-free domain-layer classes and methods involved in this feature's architecture, we need to define the test matrix for automated testing of the behavior of these classes and methods. This should be put in this feature's tests.yaml, which must conform to the JSON schema in test_matrix.json as previously mentioned.
