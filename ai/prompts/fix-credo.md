THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I want you to fix credo/linter issues. Here is how you reproduce the issues:
    | To run the linter for the entire application: `mix credo --strict`
    | To run the linter for a single file: `mix credo --strict <file>`
    |
    | It's important to always add the `--strict` flag.
    | - If `--strict` isn't set, then credo will not detect certain issues that are important for code health.

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
