Follow this process:
1. Run the tool for the entire application
2. If there are no issues, you are done.
3. Identify the first 5 issues
4. Use up to 5 subagents, one for each of the 5 issues. That subagent is
   responsible for fixing that issue and only that issue.
5. Once the 5 identified issues are all addressed, go back to step 1
