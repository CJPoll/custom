1. Run the tool for the entire application
2. If there are no issues, you are done.
3. Identify up to 5 files with issues
4. Use up to 5 subagents, one for each of the 5 files. That subagent is
responsible for fixing the issues in that file.
5. Once the 5 identified files are all addressed, go back to step 1
