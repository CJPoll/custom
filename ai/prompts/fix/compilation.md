THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I want you to fix compilation issues, including warnings. Here is how you
reproduce the issues:
    | To see compilation issues for the entire application: `mix clean && mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
    | Compilation warnings can not be checked against just a single file.
    |  - However, you should still only try to fix at most 5 files at a time.

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
