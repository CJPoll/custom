THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I have asked you to fix jest tests, then here is how you reproduce the issue:
    | To run tests for the entire application, from `apps/<app>/assets` run: `npm test --bail`
    | To run tests in a single test file, from `apps/<app>/assets` run: `npm test <file> --bail`

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
