THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I want you to fix broken tests. Here is how you reproduce the issues:
    | To run tests for the entire application: `mix test`
    | To run tests in a single test file: `mix test <file> --max-failures 1`

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
