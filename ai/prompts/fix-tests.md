THINK I have issues that I want you to fix. Help me debug these issues.

I want you to fix broken tests. Here is how you reproduce the issues:
    | To run tests for the entire application: `mix test --max-failures 5`
    | To run tests in a single test file: `mix test <file> --max-failures 1`
    |
    | It's important to always add the flag to test commands.
    | - If --max-failures isn't set or is set too high, we run the risk of filling up the ai context with unnecessary text.

Follow the process at @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/processes/fix.md using the
commands described above.
