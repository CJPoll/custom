THINK I have a file for which I want to generate tests: $ARGUMENTS

Do not generate any code. Do not generate any tests.

Generate for me a comprehensive test matrix for the module.
- Do not include performance tests.
- Do cover failure cases.
- Ensure every single code branch in the file is covered.

The output for the file under test MUST follow the format in
@~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/format/test-matrix

The output for the file under test MUST be saved in the file/directory structure
described in @~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/format/test-matrix-directory
