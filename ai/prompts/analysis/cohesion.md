  <context>
    <analysis_type>Module Cohesion and Hierarchical Structure Audit</analysis_type>
    <codebase_conventions>
      - Phoenix/Elixir standard project structure
      - Context modules act as facades (e.g., lib/app_name/billing.ex)
      - Internal modules nested under context directories (e.g., lib/app_name/billing/*)
    </codebase_conventions>
    <focus_areas>
      - Functional cohesion within modules
      - Proper delegation hierarchy
      - Clear separation of concerns
      - Facade pattern implementation at context boundaries
    </focus_areas>
  </context>
  
  <task>
    Analyze the provided Elixir modules for cohesion and hierarchical structure violations.
    
    <analysis_criteria>
      <module_cohesion>
        - EVALUATE: All functions in a module serve the single responsibility principle
        - IDENTIFY: Functions that belong in different modules based on their purpose
        - FLAG: Mixed concerns within a single module (e.g., business logic + data access)
        - DETECT: Functions operating at different abstraction levels
      </module_cohesion>
      
      <hierarchy_validation>
        - VERIFY: Context modules (facades) only orchestrate, never implement details
        - CHECK: Delegation flows downward only (no upward or lateral dependencies)
        - ENSURE: Internal modules don't expose functionality directly to external callers
        - VALIDATE: Each level maintains appropriate abstraction (high → low as depth increases)
      </hierarchy_validation>
      
      <dependency_rules>
        - Context modules can only call modules within their boundary
        - Internal modules cannot reference parent context functions
        - Sibling contexts communicate through public APIs only
        - Shared functionality extracted to dedicated shared contexts
      </dependency_rules>

            - Multiple unrelated responsibility clusters detected

          <data_cohesion weight="-2">
            - Functions operate on unrelated data structures
            - Example: Module has functions for both User structs and Order structs

          <temporal_cohesion weight="-1.5">
            - Functions grouped by "when" rather than "what"

          </temporal_cohesion>
          
          <logical_cohesion weight="-2">
            - Functions grouped by similar technical operation, different purposes
            - Example: "Validators" module validating users, products, and orders

          </logical_cohesion>
          
          <abstraction_level_mixing weight="-1.5">
            - High-level orchestration mixed with low-level implementation

            - Detection: Depth of call graph varies > 2 levels within module
          </abstraction_level_mixing>
          
          <inappropriate_knowledge weight="-1">
            - Module knows too much about other modules' internals
