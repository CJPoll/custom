THINK I have a ticket: $ARGUMENTS

Our goal is to complete the ticket in its entirety. We will start off by not
generating any code or tests.

Right now, do the following in order:
1. Pull the ticket information from Linear
2. Mark the ticket as "In Progress" and assign it to me
3. Identify code that is potentially relevant to the ticket
4. Summarize the identified code areas based on the format in `~/dev/custom/ai/prompts/code-explain`
5. Wait for the user to approve the context. They may optionally request additional
   information.
6. Once they approve the context, save the context at `ai-artifacts/context.md`
