# Custom Tools Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains personal development tools and configurations:
- **dotfiles/**: Personal dotfiles and configurations
- **git-custom/**: Custom git commands and aliases
- **scripts/**: Custom shell scripts and tools (including `wt` for worktree management)
- **ai/**: Stored AI prompts and default CLAUDE.md templates for projects
- **ai-artifacts/**: Working documents and plans for tool development

## Repository Structure

### dotfiles/
Configuration files for various tools and applications. These are symlinked to their appropriate locations in the home directory.

**Active Symlinks:**
```bash
~/.tmux.conf -> ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/.tmux.conf
~/.zshrc -> ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/.zshrc
~/.config/nvim/init.vim -> ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/init.vim
~/CLAUDE.md -> ~/dev/custom/ai/CLAUDE.md
```

**Theme Symlinks:**
```bash
~/.vim/colors/base16-cyberpunk.vim -> ~/dev/custom/hypr/themes/base16-cyberpunk.vim
~/.config/btop/themes/base16-cyberpunk.theme -> ~/dev/custom/hypr/themes/base16-cyberpunk.theme
```

To recreate symlinks if needed:
```bash
# Dotfiles
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/dotfiles/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/ai/CLAUDE.md ~/CLAUDE.md

# Themes
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/hypr/themes/base16-cyberpunk.vim ~/.vim/colors/base16-cyberpunk.vim
mkdir -p ~/.config/btop/themes
ln -sf ~/dev/custom/hypr/themes/base16-cyberpunk.theme ~/.config/btop/themes/base16-cyberpunk.theme
```

### git-custom/
Custom git commands that extend git's functionality. These commands can be invoked as `git <command-name>`.

### scripts/
Standalone shell scripts and tools. The most significant is `wt` (worktree management tool) which integrates with Graphite for stacked PR workflows.

### ai/
Contains AI-related resources:
- **prompts/**: Reusable prompts for various tasks
- Default `CLAUDE.md` template for Elixir projects
- Other AI workflow configurations

### .auto-completions/
ZSH completion definitions for custom commands, providing tab-completion support.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tools
1. Place scripts in the appropriate directory based on their purpose
2. Add completions to `.auto-completions/` if the tool has complex arguments
3. Document the tool's purpose and usage in its header comments
4. Consider creating a directory-level CLAUDE.md for complex subsystems

### Script Standards
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include usage information in the script
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful exit codes
- Support `--help` where appropriate

### Testing
- Test scripts in isolation before committing
- Verify completions work correctly
- Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)

### Integration
- Scripts should work well with existing tools
- Prefer composition over monolithic scripts
- Use environment variables for configuration where appropriate
- When writing scripts, the ordering of positional parameters vs flags should not matter. `wt stack open --create-sessions my-branch` should be just as valid as `wt stack open my-branch --create-sessions`
